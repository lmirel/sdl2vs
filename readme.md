SDL2 Template Solution
----------------------

This solution demonstrates how to set up a basic SDL2 project for Android in Visual Studio 2017. The solution is explained in detail on [my blog](http://trederia.blogspot.com/2017/03/building-sdl2-for-android-with-visual.html).



## Modifications 2019-01-11

The solution was upgraded to SDL 2.0.9 sources.

This version of SDL2 depends on Android SDK level 26, which at the time of writing does not ship with the latest Visual Studio.  As a result it is currently necessary to reconfigure Visual Studio to use separate installations of Android SDK and NDK.  The appropriate setting is found in Visual Studio under Tools > Options > Cross Platform > Android.

Because newer Android SDKs removed support for the Apache Ant build system, a Gradle project was substituted.  The Gradle project is a Visual Studio template and fully supported by Android/VC++.
